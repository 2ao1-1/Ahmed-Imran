  story: [
    "Hi it's me, My name is Ahmed Omran, and this is the story of my journey. A journey that began with a simple love for art and curiosity for technology, and grew into a mission to craft impactful designs where creativity meets purpose. Let me take you through it.",
    "Growing up in Egypt, I was always drawn to creative pursuits. From a young age, I found joy in sketching on paper and later experimenting with wall art, which became my first canvas for visual expression. These early experiences laid the foundation for my understanding of visual composition and design principles. Art wasn't just a hobby - it was my first language of expression, teaching me that creativity knows no bounds.",
    "My fascination with technology began during my school years. While I was intrigued by hacking and computers, it wasn't until high school that I discovered my true calling. A friend introduced me to programming, opening up a whole new world of possibilities. Discovering that front-end development was the perfect blend of my artistic inclinations and technical interests. It was like finding the missing piece of a puzzle I didn't know I was solving. Despite facing academic challenges that prevented me from pursuing a traditional university education, my passion for technology never wavered. I took control of my learning journey, teaching myself the foundations of web development. Each new technology I learned felt like adding another color to my palette, enabling me to create more vibrant and dynamic web experiences.",
    "Today, I combine my artistic background with technical skills to create intuitive, user-centered web solutions. My journey has taught me that limitations are often just opportunities in disguise. I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on projects where I can contribute my unique perspective and continue growing as a developer. Each project is a new canvas, and every line of code is a brushstroke in creating something meaningful.",
